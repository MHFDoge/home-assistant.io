Assist is our feature to allow you to control Home Assistant by voice. It is built on top of an open voice foundation and powered by knowledge provided by our community.

Assist is available on most platforms that can interface with Home Assistant. Look for the Assist icon <img src='/images/assist/assist-icon.svg' alt='Assist icon' style='height: 32px' class='no-shadow'>:

- Inside the Home Assistant UI in the top-right corner
- On Android Watch under [available tiles](/docs/assist/android)
- On Apple devices, using [Assist shortcuts](/docs/assist/apple)

Use the [built-in sentences](/docs/assist/builtin_sentences) to control entities and areas, or [create your own](/docs/assist/custom_sentences).

Did Assist not understand your sentence? [Contribute them.](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/voice/intent-recognition/)
